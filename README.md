This projecy is meant to simulate what its like to have a cat.
To Play this simulator you only need your mouse.

the cat will follow your mouse and paw at it when its upset. the cat can be upset because its too hot, too cold , or hunrgry. to feed the cat press the right cupboard and then anywhere on the screen. then lead the cat to food.

to heat up the cat press the left cupboard to grab wood, then press the fireplace to bring up the heat. if it gets too hot you can open a window too cool off the cat.

*note* the heat in the house gradually decreases.
